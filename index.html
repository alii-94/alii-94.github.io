    READ the other day some veises 
written by an eminent painter which 
were originsJ and not conventional. 
Always the soul hears an admonition 
in such lines, let the subject be what 

it may. The sentiment they instill is 

of more value than any thought they may contain. 
To believe your own thought, to believe that what 
is true for you in your private heart, is true for all 
men, — that is genius. 
<div class="ads">This is an ad</div>
Speak your latent conviction and it shall be the 
universal sense; for always the iiunost becomes the 
outmost, — ^and our first thought is rendered back to 
us by the trumpets of the Last Judgment. 
Familiar as the voice of the mind is to each, the 
highest merit we ascribe to Moses, Plato and Milton, 
is that they set at naught books and traditions, and 
spoke not what men, but what they, thought. A 
man should learn to detect and watch that gleam of 
light which Hashes across his mind from within, more 
than the lustre of the firmament of bards and sages. 
Yet he dismisses without notice his thought, because 
it is his. In every work of genius we recognize our own 
i^Uarae rejected thoughts: they come back to us with a 

certain alienated majesty. Great works of art have 
no more affecting lesson for us than this. They teach 
us to abide by our spontaneous impression with good 
humored inflexibility then most when the whole cry 
of voices is on the other side. Else, to-morrow a 
stranger will say with masterly good sense precisely 
what we have thought and felt all the time, and we 
shall be forced to take with shame our own opinion 
from another. 

There is a time in every man*s education when he 
arrives at the conviction that envy is ignorance; that 
imitation is suicide; that he must take himself for 
better, for worse, as his portion; that though the 
wide universe is full of good, no kernel of nourishing 
corn can come to him but through his toil bestowed 
on that plot of ground which is given to him to till. 
The power which resides in him is new in nature, 
and none but he knows what that is which he can 
do, nor does he know until he has tried. 
Not for nothing one face, one character, one fact 
makes much impression on him, and another none.
